# ANN-from-Scratch
Made an ANN from Scratch using a poorly chosen sample from Galton's height dataset. This was meant to be a learning project, thus data processing was weird. 

This was purely for learning the mathematics behind Artificial Neural Networks. Computed and processed forward propogation by hand and manually did partial derivatives for weights. This is still fairly incomplete as I have not looked into other factors that impact neural networks (better loss, activations, perhaps add dropout) and have not yet run the backpropogation on the network.
