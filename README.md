# ANN-from-Scratch 
Made an ANN from Scratch using 

This was purely for learning the mathematics behind Artificial Neural Networks. Computed and processed forward propogation by hand and manually did partial derivatives for weights. Dataset was of housing in taiwan(link included below). Also, Used RMSE as an evaluation metric for regression, achieved RMSE value of 0.15.

Future steps:
-Implement second order gradient descent optimizer (adam, RMSProp etc)
-Implement dropout
